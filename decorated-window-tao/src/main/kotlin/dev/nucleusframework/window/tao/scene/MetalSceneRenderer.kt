/**
 * Stage-2 render split (AWT/skiko `dispatcherToBlockOn` pattern): the per-frame
 * Skia/Metal dance is divided into a **record** phase that runs on the macOS main
 * thread and a **replay/present** phase that runs on a dedicated background render
 * thread.
 *
 *  - [recordSceneToPicture] (main thread): drives Compose's measure/layout/draw
 *    into a [Picture] via a [PictureRecorder]. **No GPU, no native calls, no
 *    `DirectContext`.** Compose state is only ever touched here, on the scene's
 *    own (main) thread.
 *  - [replayPictureToFrame] (render thread): acquires a Metal drawable, wraps it
 *    in a Skia [Surface], replays the recorded [Picture], flushes, and presents.
 *    All `DirectContext`-bound work lives here so Skia's Metal context
 *    thread-affinity is respected.
 *
 * Splitting the frame this way keeps the GPU command encoding (`flushAndSubmit`)
 * and the potentially-blocking `nextDrawable` off the main thread, so the Tao
 * event loop stays responsive to input even under heavy per-frame GPU load —
 * matching how skiko's `SkiaLayer.update` records on the main thread while
 * `ContextHandler.draw()` replays on `dispatcherToBlockOn`.
 *
 * Skia's Metal API requires re-creating the [Surface] every frame because each
 * drawable wraps a different texture, so the per-frame allocations in
 * [replayPictureToFrame] are unavoidable.

 * and returns `false` (the [present] lambda is **not** invoked — there is no
 * drawable to balance). If [Surface.makeFromBackendRenderTarget] returns null
 * the drawable is still presented (untextured) so the Metal command queue stays
 * balanced.
 *
 * [present] lets callers swap the default async present
 * (`NativeMetalBridge.nativePresent`) for the synchronous
 * `nativePresentWithInterop` path when AppKit subview mutations need to commit
 * atomically with the Compose frame. When a drawable was acquired, the lambda is
 * invoked exactly once — including from the failure-path `finally` — so callers
 * relying on it to drain side state (e.g. an interop transaction) don't need to
 * handle missed calls.
