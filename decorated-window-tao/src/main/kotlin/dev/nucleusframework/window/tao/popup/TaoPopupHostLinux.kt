 * Linux counterpart to [TaoPopupHost] (macOS) / [TaoPopupHostWindows].

 *
 * macOS keys on `parentNsView`, Windows on `parentHwnd`; Linux keys on the
 * parent [TaoWindow] itself — popup layers are real Tao popup windows
 * (`openWindow(popupOf = parent)`: GTK_WINDOW_POPUP, override-redirect on
 * X11, `wl_subsurface` on Wayland) so they need the parent handle, not a
 * raw native pointer.
 *
 * Threading: every call must run on the Tao event-loop thread.
