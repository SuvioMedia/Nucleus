/**
 * JNI bridge for external GPU texture import (TextureView) on Linux.
 * The native code lives in `nucleus_tao_texture_linux.c`, compiled into
 * `libnucleus_tao_egl.so` — loading is delegated to [NativeTaoEglBridge]
 * (JNI method resolution searches every library loaded by the class loader,
 * so no second `load` is needed). Same arrangement as `nucleus_tao_texture.c`
 * inside `nucleus_tao_gl.dll` on Windows.
 *
 * Import and destroy must run with the target surface's EGL context current on
 * the calling thread: they create/delete GL objects owned by the Skia
 * `DirectContext` of that context. On Linux that is the natural state —
 * composition and the draw pass both run inside `ComposeScene.render()`,
 * between the host's `nativeMakeCurrent` and `nativeReleaseCurrent` — and
 * [nativeIsAttachmentCurrent] lets the caller verify it.
 *
 * There is no per-frame native call: the imported texture aliases the
 * producer's DMA-BUF, so a producer's writes are visible to the next Skia draw
 * that samples it (true zero copy, like the Windows `MISC_SHARED` path) — unless
 * the producer hands over an acquire fence, which costs one [nativeWaitFence]
 * per frame per surface and still never blocks a thread.
 *
 * Planar YUV goes through [nativeImportDmaBuf] as well, once per plane: the
 * accepted FourCCs include the plane formats, and the Kotlin side samples the
 * resulting textures through one conversion shader.
 *
 * The test producer owns a private GBM device + EGL context and is safe from
 * any single producer thread (it binds its context per call).
