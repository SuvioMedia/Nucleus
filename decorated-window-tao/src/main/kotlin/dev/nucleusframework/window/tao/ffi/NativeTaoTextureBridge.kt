/**
 * JNI bridge for external GPU texture import (TextureView) on Windows.

 * `nucleus_tao_gl.dll` — loading is delegated to [NativeTaoGlBridge]
 * (JNI method resolution searches every library loaded by the class
 * loader, so no second `load` is needed).
 *
 * Import/update/destroy must run on the Tao event-loop thread, like
 * every other entry point touching the process EGL context. The test
 * producer owns its own D3D11 device and is safe from any single
 * producer thread.

     * Imports a legacy DXGI shared handle (`IDXGIResource::GetSharedHandle`)
     * as a GL ES texture in the host window's ANGLE context: the shared
     * D3D11 resource is opened on ANGLE's own device and bound to a pbuffer
     * (`EGL_D3D_TEXTURE_ANGLE`), whose colour buffer is then bound onto a
     * fresh texture id via `eglBindTexImage`.
     *
     * When the producer texture carries an `IDXGIKeyedMutex`
     * (`D3D11_RESOURCE_MISC_SHARED_KEYEDMUTEX`), the pbuffer wraps a private
     * staging texture instead and [nativeUpdateFrame] copies under the mutex
     * — tear-free at the cost of one GPU copy per frame. Without a mutex the
     * shared texture is sampled directly (true zero copy).

     * NT handles (`D3D11_RESOURCE_MISC_SHARED_NTHANDLE`) are not supported
     * by ANGLE's share-handle path. Returns an opaque handle, or `<= 0` on
     * failure — negative values encode the failing stage for diagnostics
     * (`-1` EGL entry points missing, `-2` no host EGL context,
     * `-0x2000X` device/OpenSharedResource failure, `-0x3/4/5xxxx`
     * pbuffer/make-current/bind failure with the EGL error in the low bits).
