/**
 * Windows: the ANGLE/Skia surface the enclosing Compose scene draws into.
 * Consumed by the `TextureView` composable, which must adopt its imported GL
 * texture into the very Skia context that will paint the scene — a GPU image
 * belongs to exactly one `DirectContext`.
 *
 * Windows keeps one `EGLContext` per *surface owner*, not one per process: each
 * window host registers its own on `nativeAttach` (keyed by HWND), overlay and
 * popup layers borrow their parent host's, and ownerless tray panels bind the
 * immortal headless one. [hostHwnd] is what picks the right trio, so the import
 * needs no context switch of its own. The Skia context follows the same split:
 * a window scene ([TaoComposeSceneHostWindows]) and a standalone tray panel
 * ([dev.nucleusframework.window.tao.popup.TaoStandalonePopupHost]) each build
 * their own, so each provides its own [LocalTaoWindowsTextureHost]. Overlay and
 * popup layers render through the host scene's context and simply inherit it.
 *
 * This is deliberately narrower than [dev.nucleusframework.window.tao.popup.TaoPopupHostWindows]:
 * the tray panel is not a popup host and cannot implement that surface, but it
 * can host a `TextureView`.
 *
 * Threading: everything here runs on the Tao event-loop thread.

 * teardown) from a path that can run inside **another** surface's render pass.
 *
 * The Windows counterpart of Linux' `preservingEglBinding`. A
 * `TaoStandalonePopup` composed into a live window builds its host from
 * `remember {}`, sizes it from the caller's layout and disposes it from
 * `onDispose` — all inside the window scene's `ComposeScene.render()`. Leaving
 * the panel's headless context and 1x1 pbuffer current there sends the
 * remainder of that frame — `applyFrameDecoration`, glyph-atlas uploads,
 * `flushAndSubmit` — into the panel instead of the window.
 *
 * When nothing was current beforehand the thread is left unbound: the surface
 * [block] bound is the caller's own, and the next unrelated GL work on this
 * thread — a window host's frame, an overlay renderer — must not inherit it.
 * Every such consumer binds its own surface at entry, so unbinding costs
 * nothing; leaving a 1x1 panel pbuffer current costs a corrupted frame.
 *
 * See [preservingBinding] for the save/restore contract, and
 * [preservingEglBinding] for the Linux counterpart.
